Composite pattern is used where we need to treat a group of objects in similar way as a single object.
Composite pattern composes objects in term of a tree structure to represent part as well as whole hierarchy.
This type of design pattern comes under structural pattern as this pattern creates a tree structure of group of objects.

eg CEO is an employee, and CEO also contains the list of the people who directly report to CEO lets say managers.
Noe manager is an employee, and manager contains the list of the people who directly report to mangager lets say developer.
so its like a hierarchy type structures.

this pattern used composite objects pattern means aggregation over inheritance
